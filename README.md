# ðŸ“ˆ FourCastNet vs ERA5 â€“ RMSE Evaluation over India (June 2021)

This project compares forecasts generated by [FourCastNet](https://github.com/NVlabs/FourCastNet) to ERA5 reanalysis data over the Indian region. RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) is used as the main evaluation metric across key meteorological variables for a 10-day forecast.

## ðŸ“Š Evaluated Variables

- Temperature (K) @ 500 hPa
- U Wind (m/s) @ 500 hPa
- V Wind (m/s) @ 500 hPa
- Mean Sea Level Pressure (MSLP in hPa)

data/ â†’ Input datasets (or sample subset)
report/ â†’ Final PDF report
results/ â†’ RMSE table + generated plots


## ðŸ“ˆ Results Overview

- RMSE for temperature and wind increases logically with lead time.
- MSLP shows abnormal flat RMSE early on â€” likely a data artifact or interpolation issue.
- Forecasts remain accurate up to 5â€“6 days, aligning with medium-range forecast standards.
